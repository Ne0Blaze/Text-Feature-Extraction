We can use SciKit and its Feature Extraction from Text tool to identify amd match if the message is spam
Using a labled data set and Supervised learnig method we can train a model to predict if the message is spam or not 
I have used a train test split to train and test out the model but the model is able to predict on new messages as well


The same can be done over different set of labled data -Movie Reviews-


NOTE# The data used to train the model is also included
